table makde of cylender, wide and short
3 ways to scale, 1 use scale tool and grab, 2. move slider, 3. pick units (best way, not random)
rest of table was made of pipe, starts ar (0,0,0)
more subdivisions make is smoother
legs made, with deformer. took cube, made it taller
mesh, mesh tools
deformers, bend
deform, non linear, bend
	deformer is a slider
	need subdivisions to bend, needs edges top and bottom
		hrizontal subdivisoons needed

	if you deform something, duplicate for multiple objects

	delete, by tyoe, history -> will rid of deformer
	better to have object off screep with its deforms somewhere else, and just have copies in screen
	to duplicate, you can copy and paste or use duplicate
	\bend deformer in deformer meneu

when making something, have the real world object as reference for dimensions
t-shirt (is in book)
	cube
	width 20
	height 20
	depth 5
	subdivisions 3 vertical
	subdivisons 5 height
	
	extrude tool
	face mode, right click and pull to face mode to extrude
	right clock to object mode
	under mesh, tool called smooth, set to 1
		smoothing breaks surface into subpolygons, to faces at a right angle, it will insert two faces to smooth it out
	settings on smooth, set to 3, much more smooth
	back into object mode via right click
	go from modeling to fx
	go to "cloth", n-cloth
	create plane, scale it up
	still in object mode on plane, lower it below shirt
	go to encloth, create passive colider (it wont move, but things will hit it)
	select object the tshirt
	field/solvers, create gravity (can change and set it any way)
	left click timeline, can run it

ctrl pluse left click, tubling the chamera around
scroll dollies the camera in and out

stack of rectangles, get something called "layers"
with tshit selected, layer, create layer from selected, can make it invisable or visable


clean new scene
in the 4 views
	nerves modeling, make curves and turn curves into surfices
curve, line modeling, cv line(?)
click to put vertexes to determine where curve goes
then hit enter
surfaces, revolve
