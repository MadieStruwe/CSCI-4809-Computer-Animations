# CSCI-4809-Computer-Animations

notes for CSCI 4809 Computer Animations for Fall 2018

This is my GitHub that contains school work and projects I have or am working on. My intention of creating this account is so I can show employers work I have done and how I have progressed as a programmer. Please do not copy any code, files, or parts there of. I do not give concent for people to not use my work unless either I have given concent or the code in here is already open source and free to use. Do NOT remove the credits of open source code or citations.
