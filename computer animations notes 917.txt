HW1 talk of making an object in a scene 
not graded on quality, but if we did it
(table top)
create polygon cube
make it wider and longer
right clck in edge mode, shift the top edges
bevel -> turns an edge into a face
edit mesh 
(table legs)
create, cd curve tool
click create line, revolve
4 legs, 
create heracrchy, make the legs children of the table top

create a light in the sence 
create light that is native to maya (directional light, simulates the sum)
doesnt matter were or size, what matters is orentatin in 3 space
go in hypershade
create, arnold shader surface, arnald standard surface
right click material, graph network
left click base color, can choose color, but instead go to chechardboard, 2d textures, file
file in graph network, click yellow folder, we want to have the files in source images
objct mode on the table, select the whole thing, right click the material in hypershade and assign it, pull up render window
hypershade, light, light tab, bring up intensit
reapeat attribute for the texture, increase it 
in photoshop (krita), go to maya, project, default, source images (find the one used), create new luminocity layer, save as a jpeg (good idea to actually change the name)
back in hypershade, material square, bumpmapping, do that same thing as before to find the file and must rematch the tiling
if white spots, material, proerties, make colors darker than white (specular highlights?)
change directiosn
go to material, douplicate, grab it, go to its graph nework,placment nodes, rotate frame 90
select the legs (because they are children) and put the maieral on via a right click
creaet polugon cube, scale it up! simulate a room sorta, render it again and see there is no liht
arnold, lights, skydome light, intensity is 1 and exposue is 0 (gotta fix that, need non 0 exposure to work)
go to top of cube, deleate top face, its floating and there is no shadows
object mode, grab the move tool and lower it until it is on the bottom
now there will be some shadows
create, cameras, create camera
grab camera with move tool, line it up with table
panel, perspective, camera 1 (see what acamera sees)
4 way view, panel, perspective, camera 1, zoom out in orthoginal to see the cameras
***s means make a key frame***

save video as masterfile
